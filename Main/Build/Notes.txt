PowerShell Build - Notes to Self

The PowerShell build requires the ability to execute scriots, which is disabled by default.

Review your execution policy with the following command
	Get-ExecutionPolicy

You can allow signed scripts to be run
	Set-ExecutionPolicy AllSigned


To re-sign the scripts if required
	Set-AuthenticodeSignature c:\foo.ps1 @(Get-ChildItem cert:\CurrentUser\My -codesigning)[0]

	Set-AuthenticodeSignature C:\Projects\CodePlex\ExpressionEditor\Main\Build\psake.ps1 @(Get-ChildItem cert:\CurrentUser\My -codesigning)[0]


This uses the default coding signing certificate.

To trust these signed scripts you may need to import the certificate public key into a trusted container.
